# Class-Activation-Maps-for-American-Sign-Language--Digits

Class Activation Maps(CAM) are an easy way to understand where the trained CNN is looking at while making predictions. It also helps to ensure whether or not the model is trained properly. More on this can be found here https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.04150.pdf.

Dataset for training the CAM model can be downloaded here github.com/ardamavi/Sign-Language-Digits-Dataset. And the pretrained VGG16 model for weight initialization resides in http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~frossard/post/vgg16/.
